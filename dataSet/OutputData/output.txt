Importance and Challenges in 
Cyber Security
• Growing digital dependence in all sectors
–Rapid increase in cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities
–Shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals
–Challenges: evolving threats, zero-day attacks, 
insider threats
–Need for continuous monitoring and updated 
security policies

Importance of Cyber Security
1. Protection of Sensitive Information
1. Organizations store huge volumes of sensitive 
data such as:
2. Personal data (PII), financial details, passwords
3. Intellectual property (IP)
4. National security information
5. Cybersecurity safeguards data from theft, 
manipulation, or unauthorized access.

Importance of Cyber Security
2. Ensuring Business Continuity
–Cyber-attacks like ransomware or DDoS can halt 
business operations.
–Strong cybersecurity ensures continuous 
functioning of critical systems and minimizes 
downtime.

Importance of Cyber Security
3. Protection Against Financial Loss
–Cyber incidents can cause:
–Direct financial loss (fraud, ransomware)
–Indirect loss (reputation damage, legal penalties)
–Businesses face millions of dollars of economic 
damage per breach.

Importance of Cyber Security
4. Maintaining Trust and Reputation
–Customers expect their information to remain 
private and safe.
–A security breach can permanently damage an 
organization’s reputation, causing customer churn 
and legal consequences.

Cyberspace & Cyber Threat
5. Safeguarding National Security
–Critical infrastructure like power grids, telecom, 
water supply, defence systems rely on digital 
networks.
–Cybersecurity is essential to prevent nation-state 
attacks targeting essential systems.

Cyberspace & Cyber Threat
6. Preventing Cybercrime Growth
–Cybercriminal activities (scams, phishing, identity 
theft, ransomware, social engineering) are 
increasing.
–A robust cybersecurity ecosystem reduces 
opportunities for attackers.

7. Protection in the Age of IoT & AI
–Devices such as smart cameras, sensors, medical 
devices, autonomous vehicles are always 
connected.
–Cybersecurity ensures secure communication, 
avoids privacy leaks, and prevents hijacking of IoT 
systems.

Cyberspace & Cyber Threat
8. Regulatory Compliance
–Governments mandate data protection laws (e.g., 
GDPR, DPDP Act 2023 in India).
–Cybersecurity ensures compliance, avoiding legal 
penalties.

Cyber Warfare
• Use of digital attacks by nations to damage or 
disrupt operations
–Objectives: espionage, disruption, infrastructure 
damage
–Techniques: cyber espionage, sabotage, data 
theft, misinformation
–Impact: national security risks and geopolitical 
tensions

CIA Triad
• Confidentiality: Preventing unauthorized 
access
–Integrity: Ensuring data accuracy and 
trustworthiness
–Availability: Ensuring systems are accessible when 
needed
–Foundation of all cybersecurity policies and 
practices

Cyber Terrorism
• Use of cyber attacks to create fear and disrupt 
society
–Targets: government systems, financial networks, 
public utilities
–Motives: political, ideological, or religious
–Methods: propaganda, defacement, infrastructure 
attacks

Cyber Security of Critical 
Infrastructure
• Critical sectors: energy, power grid, 
transportation, health
–Risks: nation‑state attacks, ransomware, system 
failures
–Consequences: large‑scale disruption and public 
safety risks
–Need for strong monitoring, regulation, and 
security frameworks
