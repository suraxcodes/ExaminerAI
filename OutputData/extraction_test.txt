Process Payment

Problems of Traditional wholesale system :-

1. Wholesale markets can't compete with foreign wholesale enterprises with advanced management & operation methods.

2. Wholesale Operating Costsincluding staffing,setting up local warehouses, establishing distribution centres are high.

• Retailers provideslink between consumers & manufacturers - adding value to products by making it easier for manufacturers to sell and consumersto buy.

• Costly and time consuming to locate, contact and make a purchase from the manufacturer every time to buy.

• Also costly for the manufacturers to locate and distribute them to consumers individually.

• Brings multitudes of manufacturers and consumers together at a single point - makes it possible for products to be sold and business to be done.

• Services by retailers make it less risky & more fun to buy products. • Retailers answers questions, display products for consumers to see before buying.

• Retailers provides extra services from personal shopping to gift wrapping & delivery, thus increasing product value.

Role of E-Commerce in Retailing :-

• Traditional retailers are needed for those who need personal check of products, and for personal services which need face-to-face interaction with the consumer. Eg. Hair-styling.

• Consumers often want to see, touch and try them before they buy.

Models of e-commerce

There are four main general e-commerce models: ▪ Business to Business (or B2B) e-commerce (sometimes called e-procurement)

• Business to Consumer (or B2C) e-commerce ▪ Business-to-government (or B2G) e-commerce ▪ Consumer-to-consumer (or C2C) e-commerce

"Business-to-business" (B2B) commerce

refers to businesses purchasing goods

from other businesses, generally over the

Internet.

• It involves a business at both ends

of transaction.

• Unlike the B2C, the buyer and s e l l

e r b o t h a r e b u si n e ss organizations.

• Buyers and sellers are connected

to each other via a virtual market place.

-Companies doing business with each other such as manufacturers selling to distributors and wholesalers selling to retailers.

-The market for Business to Business E-Commerce is potentially much bigger than business to consumer e-commerce.

-Allows companies to transfer information easier.

-The volume of B2B transactions is much higher than the volume of B2C transactions.

-Financial transactions can be processed quicker and more efficiently. -The payment method is generally bank to bank money transfer.

-For example, an automobile manufacturer makes several B2B transactions such as buying tires, glass for windscreens, and rubber hoses for its vehicles. The final transaction, a finished vehicle sold to the consumer, is a single (B2C) transaction.

• It involves customers purchasing goods over the Internet. - Involves a business as seller at one side and a consumer (end-user) as buyer at the other side.

• Businesses selling to the general public typically through catalogs utilizing shopping cart software.

• Customers can browse catalogs when they want, place an order and the product of service will be delivered directly to them.

• No need for a physical store from which to distribute products.

• Eg. of a B2C application is a retail web site featuring the business's products or services that can be directly purchased by the consumer.

• The seller may be selling products (e.g. gifts, foodstuff, books etc.) or services (information service on jobs, education, entertainment services like music/video play etc).

• In addition to online retailers, B2C has grown to include services such as online banking, travel services, online auctions, health information and real estate sites.

• Payments are usually made through credit card and goods delivered through courier or on-line (software).

Definition

• "Consumer-to-consumer " e-commerce or C2C involves the electronically-facilitated transactions between consumers through some third party.

• Eg. the online auction, in which a consumer posts an item for sale and other consumers bid to purchase it; the third party generally charges a flat fee or commission.

• The sites are only intermediaries, just there to match consumers.

• They do not have to check quality of the products being offered. - This type of e-commerce is expected to increase in the future because it cuts out the costs of using another company. - Egs. Of C2C

• eBay

• Craigslist

• Amazon.com

"Business-to-government" e-commerce or B2G is generally defined as commerce between companies and the public sector.

• Businesses sells goods or services to governments and government agencies.

• Businesses and government agencies can use central Web sites to exchange information and do business with each other more efficiently. - Business-to-government (B2G) model is also referred to as Business-to administration

• It refers to the use of the Internet for public procurement, licensing procedures, and other government-related operations.

• Web-based purchasing policies increase the transparency of the procurement process (and reduces the risk of irregularities).

• The size of the B2G e-commerce market as a component of total e commerce is insignificant, as government e-procurement systems remain undeveloped.

• Eg. Cal-Buy portal for businesses that want to sell online to the State of California

Examples of E-commerce Models

You are a computer manufacturing company who performs the following activities on the Internet:

• Purchases parts (e.g. hard drives, power supplies etc.) from a supplier (B2B)

• Sells computers to individuals (B2C)

• Sells computers to the Government to be used in schools (B2G) - On eBay.in individuals buy and sell this brand of computers (C2C)
